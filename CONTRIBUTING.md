# Contributing to VeyDigital

Thanks for your interest! For now:
- Open an Issue with a clear title and steps, or email **info@veydigital.com**.
- PRs are welcome for small fixes to the parked page (typos, links, content).
- For larger changes, please open an Issue first for alignment.

## Workflow
- Branch naming: `feature/...`, `fix/...`
- Commit messages: short and descriptive (e.g., "Fix link in Contact section")
- Keep PRs focused and small.

## Code style
- Keep HTML/CSS simple and self-contained (single-file where possible).
- No pricing in public copy. Keep language professional and concise.
